Palm leaf manuscripts are important for historical text and hold significant importance for the connection to the past and hence need to preserved. The script in the degraded
palm leaf manuscript undergoes extraction of the characters, conversion into readable words and sentences and prediction for which type of degradation status of each image. This will
ultimately be used to make a model that can accurately predict the characters in the document. Classification models are trained with the best hyper-parameters using a grid search method. The
features were selected based on the co-relation factor and the similar features were dropped. Then, different clustering methods K-Means, Agglomerative, and others were trained on the dataset along with training of different classification models and the
results were compared to yield the better results. Finally, an image analysis is done on basis of the type of degradation in the manuscript.The dataset used is patches gabor 15816 1.
